Select * from people where age <=17; -- what's happened in here?? why doesnÂ´t retry Teo???, because age is null

-- SELECT WITH AND / OR
Select * from people 
where (age <=17 and age = null); -- why dont have results?? becase when use and both condicional need be true for find -- table true

group by id; -- result no correct, why??? Because we need to group by fields.

select id from people
group by id; 

select count(*) ,id from people
group by id; 

select count(*) from people
where children = 1
group by id;

select count(*), name from people
group by id, name;

--SELECT WITH DISTINCT (just remove results duplicates)
--ADD ONE ROW DUPLICATE
insert into people (id, name, age, children) VALUES (1, 'leonardo', 36, 3);

--ORDER BY COLUMN INDEX
select * from people
order by 1;

update people 
set age = 0
where age is null; 

update people 
set children = 0
